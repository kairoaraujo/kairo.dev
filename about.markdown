I have over two decades of working with technology, and my passion for it has
never waned.

I have in architectural design, particularly for containerized and
microservice-based solutions within distributed systems. I prioritize
scalability and easy API-based integration.

Furthermore, I'm both an author and maintainer of open-source projects. You
can explore my GitHub profile, where my most notable contribution is the
"Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF)," which I initiated and is now part of the
OpenSSF/Linux Foundation ecosystem.

I'm a former System Engineer, which remains a relevant and valuable skill. I
continue to leverage my expertise in Networking, Cloud services,
Virtualization, Storage Area Networks, and Storage Disks daily.

I hail from Brazil and live in The Netherlands.
I'm a father, husband, [vinyl collector](https://www.discogs.com/user/kairoaraujo)
and [road bike enthusiastic](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6626867).
