I have over two decades of working with technology, and my passion for it has
never waned.

I have experience in architectural design, particularly for containerized
and microservice-based solutions within distributed systems focused on
scalability and easy integration.

Furthermore, I'm both an author and maintainer of open-source projects. You
can explore my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/kairoaraujo).

I love innovation and I have co-authored an patent for
[â€œAdaptive Scanning"](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP3987421B1)

I'm a former System Engineer, which remains a relevant and valuable skill. I
continue to leverage my expertise in Networking, Cloud services,
Virtualization, Storage Area Networks, and Storage Disks daily.

I hail from Brazil and live in The Netherlands.
I'm a father, husband, [vinyl collector](https://www.discogs.com/user/kairoaraujo/collection?header=1&sort=added&sort_order=asc)
and [road bike enthusiastic](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6626867).
