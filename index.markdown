I contribute to open source in the security supply chain space.

I'm currently focusing on
[Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF)](https://repository-service-tuf.readthedocs.org),
a project to secure repository
content distribution. This project is part of the
[OpenSSF/Linux Foundation](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/08/31/introducing-rstuf-repository-service-for-tuf/).
See below my talks about it.
